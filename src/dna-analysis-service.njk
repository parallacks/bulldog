                        <p class="mb-4 italic text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I took my first DNA test with Ancestry about ten years ago. I had a decent match list, with very few people I recognized. Within a few months I had multiple matches reach out to me. I had no idea how they were related to me. This led to me reading everything I could get my hands on, to help me understand how I was connected to these folks.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4 italic text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">As I started untangling centimorgans and had my dad take a test, it was becoming clear that my dad had an uncle or two that had been very prolific outside of their marriage. The most perplexing match was a man that matched my dad on BOTH maternal and paternal sides, but was NOT a sibling. This man was adopted and had very little information about his birth mother.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4 italic text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">After months of research and analysis, it was determined that his birth mother was the child of my father's paternal great uncle and maternal great aunt, resulting in double the expected shared DNA, and a strong match on both sides. After careful consideration, I asked my then-living grandmother if she knew of a niece that had been adopted out.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4 italic text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>My grandmother not only remembered, but was able to give a name, as the the girl was 6-7 years old when she was given up for adoption. The name provided by my grandmother was the name found on the suspected birth index!It was this experience that ultimately led to forming Brick Wall Bulldogs.</strong></p>
