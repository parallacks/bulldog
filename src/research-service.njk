                We research for fun! We love the thrill of the hunt as much as the victory of the discovery. 
                I have been researching my own family since I was 12, scrolling through microfiche. From combing through records 
                page by page, to deciphering difficult handwriting, to plotting maps of where your ancestors lived, put our curiosity to work for you! 
                </p>
            <p class="mb-4">When we research we make sure to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Identify direct ancestors (parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc.) and, where possible, collateral lines (aunts, uncles, cousins).</li>
                <li>Verify connections with primary and secondary source documentation.</li>
                <li>Gather key biographical details for each individual, such as birth, marriage, and death dates and locations.</li>
                <li>Organize the information into a clear, well-documented family tree format.</li>
                <li>Provide context about your ancestors' lives and the historical periods they lived in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whether you're just starting or looking to expand on existing research, we can help you build an accurate and detailed family tree with refernces to back our findings.</p>

                            First, in 1900 Ransom and Elizabeth have been married 21 years.  John R. Todd is listed as a son and 
                            is 23 years old, too old to have been born of a 21-year union.  Second, Elizabeth is the mother of 
                            "seven, four living".  There are five living children listed on this record, including 23-year-old John R. 
                            Todd.  These pieces of evidence indicate that the Elizabeth on the 1900 census is NOT John's mother,
                             since he would have been born before their marriage and
                              he would have been a fifth living child.  A third consideration is the tell-tale gap between John (23 yrs) 
                              and Myrtle (15 yrs).  This strengthens the argument that the Elizabeth of 1900 is not John's mother, since 
                              the natural distance between births is two years, which is the average distance between the remaining four children 
                              (Myrtle, Charles, Katie, and Joseph).  A fourth indicator of two separate Elizabeths is the age at which Elizabeth the 
                              Second and Ransom married.  Assuming the ages listed on the 1900 census are correct, Ransom and Elizabeth the Second would 
                              have been 31 and 29 years old, respectively, at the time of their marriage.  This is about 10 years older than the average 
                              age at first marriage for Arkansas in the late 1800s."</strong></p>
