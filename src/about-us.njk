            <p class="mb-4">Brick Wall Bulldogs was founded because we are passionate about connection. 
                Humans crave connection and we can benefit so much from understanding who we are and where we come from.  </p>
            <p class="mb-4">Much research has been done on the benefits of connecting with our ancestry.  Helen Parker-Drabble, 
                a social historian and former counsellor, says engaging with ancestry can be "absolutely life-changing" in 
                improving mental health. (Parker-Drabble, 2022.)  Youth who know more about their family history report 
                higher levels of wellbeing and self-empowerment. (Moore, 2022) </p>
            <p class="mb-4">We believe that everyone has a unique story waiting to be discovered, and we're 
                passionate about navigating the complexities of genealogical research to bring those stories to light.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Like many of our clients, we started as curious individuals fascinated by the whispers of the past. 
                This curiosity grew into a deep-seated passion for solving genealogical puzzles, understanding historical 
                contexts, and piecing together the narratives of those who came before us. We know the thrill of discovery 
                and the frustration of hitting those infamous "brick walls" - and it's this understanding that drives our commitment to your research success.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to provide expert, thorough, and compassionate genealogical services, empowering you to understand your heritage and preserve it for future generations. </p>
